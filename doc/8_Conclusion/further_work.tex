\section{Further work}

The work presented in this thesis can be improved. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item We identified that graphics hardware drivers are still not handling interoperation between Cuda and OpenGL fast enough. Using OpenGL 4.3, a raytracer could be implemented in the Compute Shader stage, which should cancel the interoperation overhead.
	\item The deferred renderer could be rewritten to take advantage of tile-based parallellization in it's lighting pass. Using OpenGL 4.3, this could also be handled in a Compute Shader now, and probably also integrate well with a Compute Shader based raytracer.
	\item Improve the BART loader to support animations. That would allow us to compare performance with other BART renderers.
	\item Extend the raytracer with intersect programs for geometry that is better suited for raytracing than rasterization, like NURBS, Meta Shapes and Distance Fields.
\end{itemize}
