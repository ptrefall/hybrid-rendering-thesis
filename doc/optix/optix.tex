\subsection{Deferred pipeline}

\subsection{CameraModel}
The raytracer uses pinhole camera model. The eye is a point, rays are cast from this point, through the viewplane and into the scene. Eyepoint-viewplane distance determines focal length. A rasterizer on the other hand requires a projection matrix.

\subsection{Geometry}

Traditional triangle meshes with vertex attributes (normals, texture coordinates etc)

\subsection{Various hybrid configurations}
